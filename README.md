Please use Google Chrome when you view this visualization.

This visualization consists of a line graph that clearly represents different statistics of Tours de France that
have taken place between 1903 and 2010. The visualization has three "modes" that allow the user to view data
concerning average speed, distance, or number of stages for the tours. Switching "modes" by clicking on the 
corresponding button will display new line graphs related to a particular statistic.

Additionally, the user is provided with details-on-demand; hovering the mouse over a data point will produce a tooltip 
containing information with the year and all of the stats pertaining to that data point. Finally, clicking on the data
point will result in the display of a small table with a list of winners and their listed country for that particular
event.

We've incorporated the use of scales, axes, tooltips, and transitions from D3 in this visualization.
